# MANIPULUS

The Invisible Interface.

Manipulus is an experimental desktop system exploring gesture-based, zero-UI interaction. It operates on the belief that the most advanced technology is the kind you do not notice.

## Philosophy

Modern environments suffer from interaction overload. Screens prompt for attention; voice assistants interrupt silence.

Manipulus prioritizes:

Zero UI
Intent over commands
Silence over noise
Local-first operation

We use computer vision not for surveillance, but for interpretation. By enabling control through movement and stillness, we remove the dashboard and return calm to the digital workspace.

## System Overview

Manipulus runs silently in the background. It transforms a standard webcam into a sensor for intent, translating a limited set of physical gestures into system actions.

It is designed to be invisible—no always-on windows, no status overlays, no visual feedback unless requested.

## Status

**Experimental.**

This system is in active development. It is a living research project. Features, behaviors, and scope will change.

## Privacy

Trust is foundational to an invisible interface.

Visual input is processed 100% locally.
No video, images, or biometric data are stored or transmitted.
No cloud services or accounts are utilized by default.
Future features involving data will remain opt-in.
