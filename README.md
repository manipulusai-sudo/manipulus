# Manipulus

Manipulus is a research-driven project exploring a new interaction paradigm between humans and physical environments.

At its core, Manipulus investigates how **intent** — not commands, apps, or continuous attention — can become the primary interface between people and machines.

This repository represents early-stage exploratory work toward that goal.

## The Problem Space

Modern environments are operated through layers of friction:
*   Screens
*   Apps
*   Voice commands
*   Cloud-mediated automation

These systems require users to translate intent into explicit instructions, breaking flow and introducing latency, privacy risk, and cognitive overhead.

Manipulus asks a different question:
**What if environments responded to validated human intent instead of explicit commands?**

## The Manipulus Thesis

Manipulus is built around three foundational principles:

### 1. Intent Over Commands
Human behavior already expresses intent through presence, attention, and action. Manipulus explores how systems can recognize deliberate intent while ignoring noise.

### 2. Privacy as a Physical Property
True privacy is achieved when intelligence remains local by design. Manipulus is researched as a local-first system, not a cloud-dependent service.

### 3. Invisible Interaction
The goal is not another interface, but the absence of one. Interaction should feel spatial, implicit, and calm — not interruptive.

## What This Repository Is

This repository contains non-production exploratory artifacts related to:
*   Intent validation logic
*   Human–environment interaction models
*   System behavior under ambiguity
*   UI concepts for transparency and trust

These artifacts are not representative of the final system, architecture, or sensing stack. They exist to test reasoning flows, not to showcase features.

## What This Repository Is Not

❌ A consumer product  
❌ A finished SDK or platform  
❌ A complete technical disclosure  
❌ A smart-home controller  

Many critical components of Manipulus — including sensing strategy, inference models, and system architecture — are intentionally not present here.

## Project Status

Manipulus is in an early research and validation phase. Development is focused on:
*   Conceptual clarity
*   Logical correctness
*   Interaction integrity

Public materials are deliberately minimal.

## Intellectual Integrity

Manipulus values honest prototypes over impressive illusions. Demonstrations prioritize:
*   Transparency of system reasoning
*   Deliberate latency over accidental activation
*   Clear boundaries between concept validation and implementation

This approach is intentional.

Manipulus is currently not accepting external contributions.
