# Manipulus

**Intent‑Validated Non‑Verbal Computing**

Manipulus is an open‑source research project exploring a future beyond the *Command Era* of technology.
Instead of issuing explicit commands (apps, buttons, wake‑words), Manipulus investigates how **human presence, gaze, and gesture** can be translated into **validated intent** — locally, privately, and invisibly.

This repository documents the *concept*, *architecture*, and *prototype direction* of Manipulus. It is not a consumer product, and it does not collect or transmit personal data.

## Vision

To liberate humans from the Command Era of technology.

We believe computing should adapt to humans — not the other way around.
A home, device, or system should respond naturally to *where you are*, *what you’re attending to*, and *what you intend* — without forcing you to reach for an app, speak a command, or surrender privacy.

Manipulus aims to become an **Intent‑Validation Operating Layer**:

* Invisible by default
* Local‑first and private
* Activated only by sustained, verifiable human intent

---

## What Manipulus Is

Manipulus is an **open‑source Non‑Verbal Communication (NVC) platform**.

You can think of it as:

> *External Telepathy for the 99%*

It explores BCI‑like capabilities (attention, intent, context) **without implants, surgery, cloud dependence, or biometric storage**.

At its core, Manipulus answers one question:

> *“Is this movement random — or is this intentional?”*

Only when intent is validated does the system act.

## What Manipulus Is Not

* ❌ Not a gesture‑control toy
* ❌ Not always‑listening
* ❌ Not cloud‑dependent
* ❌ Not a surveillance system
* ❌ Not a consumer‑ready product

Manipulus deliberately avoids twitchy, reactive automation. No action occurs without *temporal consistency* and *contextual confirmation*.

---

## Core Concept: Intent Validation

Traditional automation reacts to **events**.

Manipulus reacts to **validated intent**.

Intent is inferred only when multiple signals align *over time*, such as:

* Gaze direction
* Skeletal posture
* Gesture persistence
* Spatial context
* Duration thresholds

Example (conceptual):

> If gaze is maintained toward a defined zone *and* a gesture is sustained beyond a validation window → intent is confirmed → action is allowed.

This reduces false positives and preserves human agency.

---

## Prototyping Direction

Manipulus progresses through small, verifiable prototypes whose sole purpose is to test whether **intent can be distinguished from noise** using non-verbal signals — locally and privately.

These prototypes are intentionally minimal, disposable, and exploratory. Details are abstracted to avoid premature coupling to specific hardware, vendors, or implementations.

---

## Privacy & Safety Principles

Manipulus is designed around strict constraints:

* No biometric databases
* No facial recognition
* No identity profiling
* No cloud streaming by default
* No data resale

Raw video is processed ephemerally for inference and is not stored.

This repository contains **no keys, credentials, endpoints, or production secrets**.

---

## Repository Scope

This repo may include:

* Concept documentation
* Architectural diagrams
* Prototype logic descriptions
* Research notes
* Experimental code (clearly labeled)

Anything that could compromise privacy or security is intentionally excluded.

---

## Status

Manipulus is **early‑stage research**.

* APIs may change
* Concepts may evolve
* Nothing here should be considered production‑ready

The purpose is exploration, validation, and open discussion.

---

## Open Source & Contribution

Manipulus is built in public to invite critique, not hype.

If you’re interested in:

* Non‑verbal interfaces
* Local‑first AI
* Human‑computer interaction
* Post‑app computing

You’re welcome to observe, question, or contribute thoughtfully.

## Disclaimer

Manipulus is a research and experimental project.

It does not make medical, cognitive, or behavioral claims.
It is not a brain‑computer interface.
It is not intended for surveillance, monitoring, or behavioral enforcement.

Any demonstrations are conceptual prototypes only.

*Manipulus explores what computing could feel like when technology learns to wait for human intent — instead of interrupting it.*
